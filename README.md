# MairaLorenaVetClinic
JAVA PROJECT 

WELCOME TO MY CODE: MAIRA LORENA WALTERO GUEVARA 
This code is for demonstration purposes for my application for Graduate Software Engineer (Dublin)in DATALEX 

The code is about a Veteninarian Clinic. 
The user will have different options to display the staff information and animals information. 
In addition they are going to be able to search for a specific animal and staff. 

In this project I used: 
* Encapsulation 
* Abstraction classes
* Inheritance 
* Arrays 
* Collections (Array List and  Queues but also I know linked list, stacks, Deques, Sets and Maps) 
* Linear Search (but also I know binary search) 
* I did not use any sort but I know Bubble sort and Merge sort. 

Thanks for the oportunity.
